Bizon parser

This is a telegram bot that, using the Beautiful soup 4 library and selenium, visits the Bizon365 webinar page, passes dynamic authorization and goes through the Html code of the webinar page

After passing through the page, it finds a link to a Youtube broadcast and sends it as a response to a user request

Also, if the presenter shows a presentation on bizon 365, then the bot can also download it and upload it to the user's request
